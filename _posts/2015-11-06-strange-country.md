[The Aristocrat Lounge][0] invites you to [Strange Country][1]: an evening of sophisticated country lounging, to a soundtrack of space-age pedal steel instrumentals and spaghetti western themes. It happens the 2nd Wednesday evening of every month.Don your best Nudie suit and join Lee Hazlewood and Buck Owens for some cocktail country, redneck jazz, and '60s Nashville fuzz guitar, with the vinyl selections curated by John Schooley. This month special celebrity guest DJ [David L. Thomson III][2] joins [Schooley][3] on the Wagon Wheels of Steel(r), dipping into his collection of classic and weirdo country vinyl for your entertainment and edification. While Dave has probably served you drinks around town, his place in Austin's country music history is assured by having had a hand in getting Johnny Cash to perform at Emo's.The Aristocrat Lounge is an old-school watering hole, and this is music to drink to. The night won't be about filling the dance floor, but all about filling and re-filling your glass.
